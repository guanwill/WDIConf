_**[General Assembly Project - Not Maintained]**_

# WDIConf 2016

## Workload
### Pre rails (Partials and Static Layout).
- Divided up sections for the hero, information, booking, project sections and a booking page.
- Layout done in Balsamiq.

### Git control
- Decided on having a gitlord with forked projects that would send pull requests to minimize merge problems.
- Added rails project.
- Added partials.
- Fixed up gitignore.

### Rails, database and backend
- Added presenter models, routes and database.
- Added date information to the databse.
  - We added a countdown timer to the event from a date set in the database
```
puts Time.new(2016, 07, 17, 10, 0, 0, "+10:00")
```
- Added gem annotate.
```
Annotates Rails/ActiveRecord Models, routes, fixtures, and others based on the database schema.
```
- Project time examples from [Stack overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5474164/rails-seeding-database-data-and-date-formats).

```
startDate  => DateTime.new(2009,9,1,17)
```
- For the countdown timer we used [Countdown.js](http://countdownjs.org/).
- Used [this reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/parse) to parse a string into a date object.

### Google Maps integration
- Created a hardcoded address map with google maps from [google developers documentation](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/distance-matrix/intro#DistanceMatrixResponses).
